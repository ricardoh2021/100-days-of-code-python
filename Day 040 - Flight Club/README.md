# Day 40 of 100 Days of Code with Python

Today I built on yesterday's starter code, since my code yesterday was not the best due to feeling sick. The only thing missing from yesterday's solution was adding Twilio for whatsapp messaging. I still had fun refining the code by minimizing lines using ternary operators. This approach got me thinking about how I could apply APIs more effectively or even create my own in the future!

I also worked with POSTMAN to better understand API queries and how authorization through headers works. It’s exciting to see concepts I’ve worked with before start to click and make more sense.
