# Day 9 of 100 Days of Code

## Notes

### Python Dictionaries and Nested Dictionaries

- Day 9 focused mainly on dictionaries and nested dictionaries in Python.
- It reminded me a lot of Java HashMaps.
- This left me wondering about the performance differences between Python and Java, particularly in terms of data usage with nesting lists and dictionaries, and the efficiency of Python functions.
- Overall, I had very little trouble understanding the material and could complete the day's exercises in under an hour.
