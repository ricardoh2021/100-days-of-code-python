# Day 21 of 100 Days of Code Python

## Summary

- Finished the snake game and it was cool to finally piece things together.
- This section reminded me of my one Computer Science professor who used a chef and spaghetti analogy when teaching OOP. It was funny but helpful, making these sections go by easily.
- I didn't use the video much to figure out the solution. I only went through it once done with the part and refactored if needed.
- Was reminded about list slicing.

## Reflections

- The analogy of a chef and spaghetti helped in understanding the concepts better and made the coding process smoother.
- The challenge was more about applying what I've learned and refining the code rather than following step-by-step instructions.
- Revisiting list slicing was a useful reminder of its importance and functionality in Python.

## Next Steps

- Continue refining the Snake game and exploring additional features.
- Apply lessons learned from this project to future coding challenges.
