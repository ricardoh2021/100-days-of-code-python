## Today's Progress

Today was a rather simple day focusing on **basic CSS**. I ended up skipping most of the videos until I had to check the solution with what I coded. I had a lot of experience messing with SCSS at my time in Publicis Sapient so felt comfortable. Fighting the urge to skip the basics, but I know that it will help me. I cannot be prideful, always have something to learn.
