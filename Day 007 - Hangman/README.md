# Day 7 of 100 Days of Code

## Notes

### Python Hangman Game

- The Python hangman game was fun.
- I barely used the videos and even had some input validation in the exercises.
- I focused on remembering and thinking like a programmer, considering how things can break.
- It was a good little exercise and I hope to complete another day to make up for skipping a day.
