# First Day Back from My Trip to Mexico!

It was a really great time, and I enjoyed spending time with my family. I got to visit _Our Lady of Guadalupe_ and I ate lots of food, but I’m glad to be back to continue being better!

## Today's Progress

Today was a rather simple day focusing on **basic HTML**. I ended up skipping most of the videos until I had to check the solution with what I coded. Overall, it was a simpler day.

## Thoughts on Frontend Experience

Although I have frontend experience from my time at Publicis Sapient, I don’t want to ignore any of the videos, no matter how easy they seem. It’s always good to refresh the basics.
