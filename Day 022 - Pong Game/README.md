# Day 22: Developing Pong Game - Independent Approach

## Overview

On Day 22, I decided to tackle the Pong game project independently, without relying on instructional videos. This decision allowed me to dive deeper into the problem-solving process and utilize external resources like StackOverflow and the Turtle documentation.

## Progress

### Key Achievements

- **Independent Problem-Solving**: Successfully broke down the game development task into manageable pieces and solved issues as they arose.
- **Resource Utilization**: Effectively used StackOverflow and the Turtle documentation to guide my progress and address challenges.
- **Game Development**: Implemented the core features of the Pong game, including paddle movement, ball collision detection, and scoring.

### End Game State Issue

- **Current Status**: The end game state functionality is somewhat inconsistent. The game doesn't properly handle scenarios where a player reaches 10 points, and the transition to the game over state needs refinement.
- **Plan**: Due to time constraints and the need to complete my project for Dr. Neller before the semester starts, I will revisit this issue at a later time to refine and perfect the end game state.

## Reflection

Today's work felt rewarding as I enjoyed breaking down the problem and tackling it piece by piece. It was satisfying to see progress through my own efforts and resources, rather than following a structured guide. This experience reinforced my problem-solving skills and highlighted areas for future improvement.

## Next Steps

- **Fix End Game State**: Address the inconsistencies in the game over state and ensure a smoother transition when a player reaches 10 points.
- **Complete Project for Dr. Neller**: Prioritize finishing the current project before the semester begins.

Overall, Day 22 was a productive and insightful day, marked by significant progress and valuable learning experiences.
