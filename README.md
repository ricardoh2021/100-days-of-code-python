# 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp

Welcome to the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp** repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey through Angela Yu's comprehensive Udemy course on learning Python. I have a sufficient knowledge of Python thanks to a Data Science course I took in my senior year of college, but I would like improve my Python skills to possibly work with Data in the future. Follow along as I complete various exercises, projects, and challenges designed to build a solid foundation in Python programming. I try my best to use the video tutorials for projects as least as possible.

## Course Overview

Angela Yu's **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023** is a highly acclaimed course that covers a wide range of Python topics, from basic syntax and data structures to advanced concepts like web development, automation, and data science. This course is structured to provide hands-on experience through daily coding exercises and real-world projects.
