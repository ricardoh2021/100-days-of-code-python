# Day 003 - Notes

## Reflections

I come from a Java-heavy background, so Iâ€™m just getting used to the `if` statements in Python. I can't forget the `:`! Other than that, I'm feeling confident. I just need to remember my edge cases when programming and get back into that mindset.

## Key Points

- Adjusting to Python's syntax and conventions.
- Remembering the `:` in `if` statements.
- Focusing on edge cases in programming.
