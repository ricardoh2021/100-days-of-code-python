### Day 5 Notes

- The exercises were fairly simple given my background in Java and JavaScript with working with for loops.
- I need to brush up and continue learning about how I can best utilize Python's random methods.
- For the password generator, I was thinking too much brute force and not using the resources on hand.
- Overall, I felt confident, and just need to be aware of function parentheses and also reading docs since some functions exclude/include a number.
