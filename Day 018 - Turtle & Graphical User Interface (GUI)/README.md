## Day 18: 100 Days of Code - Python

**Date:** 08/13/2024

### Summary

Today, I explored the Turtle GUI interface in Python, which brought back memories of my very first computer science course, CS111. The exercises were pretty straightforward, and I enjoyed the process of working through them.

I spent a good amount of time refining and refactoring the code to ensure everything was as clean and efficient as possible. Overall, I felt good and confident with my progress and the results.

### Key Takeaways

- Gained hands-on experience with the Turtle module in Python.
- Focused on refactoring code for better readability and efficiency.
- Felt a strong sense of nostalgia, connecting this experience to my early days in computer science.
