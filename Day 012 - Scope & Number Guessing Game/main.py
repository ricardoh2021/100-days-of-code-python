    Play a number guessing game based on the chosen difficulty level.

    Args:
    difficulty (str): The difficulty level of the game, either 'easy' or 'hard'.

    The game allows the player a certain number of guesses to find a randomly generated number
    between 1 and 100. The number of guesses depends on the difficulty level:
    - Easy: 10 guesses
    - Hard: 5 guesses

    The player is prompted to guess the number, and feedback is provided whether the guess is too high or too low.
    The game ends when the player correctly guesses the number or runs out of guesses.
