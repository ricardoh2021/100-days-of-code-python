# 100 Days of Code - Python

## Day 12: What I Learned

- **Global Scope in Python**:

  - I learned about the global scope within Python. Variables declared at the top level of a script or module are accessible throughout the code.

- **Block Scoping in Python vs. Java**:

  - Unlike Java, Python lacks block scoping. While this is not the best practice, I plan to follow good coding habits from Java and use block scoping principles to maintain good code practices.

- **Guessing Game and Binary Search**:
  - Working on the guessing game project reminded me of the binary search algorithm, as the process of making guesses and narrowing down the possible number felt similar to binary search methodology.
